# ngdata2crm
This is a simple example of pulling data directly from the National Gallery public data endpoint and mapping it to the CIDOC CRM. This work is currently just for experimentation and testing, the mappings are not complete in any way and further work is required before the data could be used for any other applications.

Some of the python code included here was gnerated with help for current AI models as this work was seeing how well they could map data to the CRM
